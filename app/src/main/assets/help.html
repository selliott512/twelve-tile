<title>Twelve Tile Help</title>

<body>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Twelve Tile Puzzle is heavily inspired by the "M12 puzzle" that
can be found on the <a
	href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=puzzles-simple-groups-at-play">
Scientific American website</a>. The goal is to place the 12 tiles at the
top of the screen in order by pressing the first two of the three move
buttons that appear on the left side of the screen in the correct
sequence. What the two move buttons do is controlled by which of the
three puzzle types ("M12", "Bubble" and "Custom") is selected.</p>
<p>Prior to this puzzle the M12 puzzle type had been implemented as a
Java applet, which can be found on <a
	href="http://selliott.org/puzzles/m12">the author's website</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the six buttons are self explanatory, so you should just
try them. See the <a href="#buttons">buttons section</a> for a detailed
explanation of the buttons.</p>
<p>The Twelve Tile Puzzle is open source. See the <a href="#license">license
section</a> for details.</p>
<h2>Puzzle Types</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>M12</b> is quite difficult for reasons that have do with
	group theory. The M12 puzzle is the one puzzle type that this puzzle
	knows how to solve since the limited number of permutations makes it
	possible to include a comprehensive database. See the <a
		href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=puzzles-simple-groups-at-play">
	Scientific American website</a> for a discussion behind the M12 puzzle
	type. For the M12 puzzle type the "Flip" button reverses the order of
	the tiles and the "Merge" button folds the tiles back onto themselves.
	This is the default puzzle type.</li>
	<li><b>Bubble</b> is named since after the fact that it implements
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">bubble sort</a>. The
	only important difference between this puzzle type and the bubble sort
	algorithm is that for this puzzle type the place where items are swapped is
	fixed and the tiles move.</li>
	<li><b>Custom</b> is used to control exactly what first two move
	buttons do. For all puzzle types each of the two moves can be described
	by what they do to a solved puzzle. For example, for the M12 puzzle
	type the the "Flip" button takes a solved puzzle, which can be
	represented by <code>ABCDEFGHIJKL</code>, and flips it so that the
	order of the tiles is reversed, which is represented by <code>LKJIHFEDCBA</code>.
	Similarly for the custom puzzle type the two moves buttons my be
	configured by the "Custom Move 1 Result" and "Custom Move 2 Result"
	preferences on the preferences page (the page that is navigated to by
	selecting "Preferences" when the "Menu" button is pressed). Optionally
	the label that appears on the first two move buttons can be controlled
	by the "Custom Move 1 Name" and "Custom Move 2 Name" preferences on the
	preferences page.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p>The M12 puzzle type is quite difficult. Although a comprehensive
solution is beyond the scope of this document consider the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Merge changes everything other than the first tile. So it's
	possible to get the first two tiles by pressing "Merge" until <code>A</code>
	is in the last location. Then press flip to get <code>A</code> into the
	first location and finally continue to press "Merge" until <code>B</code>
	is in the second location.</li>
	<li>Using the "Cheat" preference that can be found in the
	preferences page illustrates which move gets the puzzle closer to
	solved.</li>
	<li>For the M12 puzzle type knowing the location of any five tiles
	is sufficient to deduce the location of all 12 tiles. In order to
	assist with focusing on five of the tiles try turning on the "Five"
	preference in the preferences page.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bubble puzzle type is easier than the M12 puzzle type. It's
solved by applying the <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">bubble sort</a>
algorithm. Since the "Swap" button causes the first two tiles to
exchange places press "Swap" if the first tile comes after the second
one and press "Roll" otherwise. One caveat is that one of the tiles
should not be moved. For example, never swap tile <code>A</code> with
another tile.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h3>Moves</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Move 1</b> is the first of the three move buttons. It is
		is labeled "Flip" by default, but it's label changes as a function of
		the puzzle type.</li>
		<li><b>Move 2</b> is the second of the three move buttons. It is
		is labeled "Merge" by default, but it's label changes as a function of
		the puzzle type.</li>
		<li><b>Undo</b> undoes the previous move.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3>Actions</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Random</b> picks a random permutation that is valid for
		the current puzzle type. Internally this is done by doing 100 random
		moves.</li>
		<li><b>Reset</b> restores the puzzle to it's solved state.</li>
		<li><b>Rewind</b> undoes all moves since the last time the puzzle
		was randomized by clicking the "Random" button. Use this to work on a
		particular random puzzle by quickly reverting to the same random
		puzzle.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
